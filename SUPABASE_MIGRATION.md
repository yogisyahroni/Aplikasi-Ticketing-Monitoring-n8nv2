# Supabase Real-time Data Migration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the migration from the previous API-based data fetching to Supabase real-time data handling in the ticketing and monitoring application.

## Key Changes

### 1. Hooks Implementation
- Replaced API client calls with custom Supabase hooks:
  - `useTickets` - For ticket management
  - `useBroadcastLogs` - For monitoring logs
  - `useUsers` - For user management

### 2. Client-side Filtering and Pagination
- Implemented client-side filtering and pagination for all pages
- Created filtered and paginated data sets based on user search criteria
- Updated pagination controls to use current pagination state

### 3. Real-time Data Updates
- Removed WebSocket context and replaced with Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Implemented automatic data updates when changes occur in the database
- Eliminated manual refresh calls after CRUD operations

## Implementation Details

### Pages Updated
- Tickets.tsx
- Monitoring.tsx
- Users.tsx

### Data Flow
1. Data is fetched once on component mount using Supabase hooks
2. Real-time subscriptions update data automatically when changes occur
3. Client-side filtering and pagination handle data presentation
4. CRUD operations update the database directly through Supabase hooks

## Testing
- Verify real-time updates across all pages
- Test CRUD operations to ensure they update the UI automatically
- Confirm filtering and pagination work correctly with the new data flow
